HBnB Evolution - Business Logic & API Implementation1. IntroductionFollowing the architectural blueprints defined in Part 1, this phase focuses on the actual implementation of the HBnB Evolution core. We transition from conceptual UML diagrams to a functional RESTful API. This stage implements the Business Logic Layer, the Presentation Layer, and an initial In-Memory Persistence Layer to validate the system's behavior.2. Implementation ArchitectureThe codebase strictly follows the Layered Architecture and the Facade Pattern to ensure modularity:Services (Facade): A unified interface that mediates between the API controllers and the underlying models.Models: Python implementation of the User, Place, Review, and Amenity entities.Data Validation: Logic to ensure data integrity (e.g., unique emails, valid ratings).In-Memory Storage: A temporary repository used to store objects during runtime before the SQL integration in Part 3.3. Core Entities & Business RulesEvery entity inherits from a BaseModel to provide a consistent structure:User: Handles authentication and profile data.Place: Manages listings, linked to a specific Owner (User).Review: Links a User to a Place with a rating and comment.Amenity: Represents individual features (e.g., "WiFi", "Air Conditioning").Python# Base model for all entities
# Provides unique ID and timestamps for every object
class BaseModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.created_at = datetime.now()
        self.updated_at = datetime.now()
4. API Endpoints (Presentation Layer)The API is organized into versioned namespaces (/api/v1/). Key endpoints implemented in this phase:EndpointMethodDescription/users/POSTCreate a new user profile/places/GETRetrieve all property listings/reviews/POSTSubmit feedback for a specific place/amenities/GETList all available features5. Development SetupTo run the application locally:Environment: Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed.Dependencies: Install the required packages:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Run: Execute the main entry point:Bashpython run.py
How to explore this implementationCheck the /models/ directory: To see the OOP implementation of the business entities.Check the /api/ directory: To see how Flask-RESTX defines the endpoints and namespaces.Check the /services/ directory: To see the Facade pattern in action, centralizing the app logic.
