# Holberton School - HBnB Evolution

## Project Overview
HBnB Evolution is a complete software development project that mimics a simplified version of AirBnB. The goal is to build a full-stack application following professional software engineering standards, including:
- Layered Architecture
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- RESTful API design
- Database persistence

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized by parts, representing the different stages of the development lifecycle:

- **[Part 1: Technical Documentation](./part1/)**: Design phase including UML diagrams (Package, Class, and Sequence diagrams).
- **Part 2: Business Logic**: Implementation of core models and services (Coming soon).
- **Part 3: Database & Persistence**: Integration of the database (Coming soon).

## Documentation
The technical design and architectural blueprints can be found in the `part1` directory. These diagrams were created using Mermaid.js and follow UML standards.
